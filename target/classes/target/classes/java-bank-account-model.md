Let's use class design to model the concept of a Bank Account

## Getting Started

```no-highlight
et get java-bank-account-model
cd java-bank-account-model
idea .
```

We have supplied a `BankAccountRunner.java` file that defines the desired behaviors of your `BankAccount` class.

You will have to create the class, create the correct getters and setters, and define `deposit` and `withdrawal` methods.

Implement the required behaviors, and ensure your output from running `BankAccountRunner` matches the following:

```no-highlight
The account number is 2323121
The balance is 799.5
You withdrew: 799.5
Your new balance is: 0.0

Process finished with exit code 0
```

You should not have to modify `BankAccountRunner.java`.
